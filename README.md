Memory Rythm is a simon says like game with dance moves!!! Developed for the Pre-Jam 5 Warmup on the Arduboy forum.

Memory Rythm will feature a sprite that does a different action for each of the six buttons (up, down, left, right, B, and A)
and will perform a series of actions then you must press the correct buttons in order to playback those actions. In simon says
fashion a new action will be added onto the end of the sequence each round and the speed at which the actions are played back will increase
and the delay between actions will decrease.

Will you be able to keep up with the beat?
